• Overexpression of AKT2 is linked to metastasis in colorectal, ovarian & breast cancer.
• Docking study revealed binding affinities ranging from −10.9 to −9.8kcal/mol at most.
• Three lead compounds were selected with excellent ADMET profiles.
• 100 ns MD simulation ensured eminent binding stability; comparable to Capivasertib.
